# Stanford-CS106
Items related to Stanford's course CS106 (Programming Abstractions w/ C++)

I have done some assignments from the archived version of the course from 2008, and some from the current 2018 offering. 
The topics and assignments are largely the same. I will post some of the work to this repository.

Dependencies for these files include the Stanford C++ Library, which provides tons of functionality, including user-friendly (and beginner friendly) versions of the STL.
